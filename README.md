# Impossible-Game
 2D platformer made with unity

 This was our first school assignment.
 Purpose was to get a first look at the Unity engine and try out Visual Scripting.
 With the Player always moving at a fixed speed on the X-Axis i just had to implement a jumping mechaninc.
 Started Playing around with the level design and decided to keep a bug in wich enabled the player to "climb" up the tree.
 Took inspiration from this and decided to make a 2D Tarzan jumping game.
